# HungryBook

Tired to listening to restaurant's owners and food entrepeneurs we start to build something for them.

This is a open-source software that has the intention to help the food community and share information with everyone.

The goal is gathering every single choice of restaurant, bars, bakeries and so on in a unique place. A place that doesn't charge any price and is free to use and download.

Join us, contribute for this project and share with those you care about.

# HungryBook

Listening to restaurant's owners and food entrepeneurs we start to build something for them.

This is an open-source software that has the intention to help the food community and share information with everyone.

The goal is gathering every single choice of restaurant, bars, bakeries and so on in a unique place. A place that doesn't charge any price and is free for use.

Join us and contribute for this project.
